## About me

Interested in backend development, and DevOps. Ð¡an also take a tech lead position, however I believe I still have something to learn as a software developer. Like infrastructure and internal projects more than mass-market projects. 

Don't code all the time as a hobby, however sometimes I do work on my own ideas, and help friends with theirs. Most notable of those: group chat Telegram-bot named [Social Credit Bot](https://github.com/kapralnsk/tg-social-credit-bot), and YouTube-video to podcast conversion service named [audeeo](https://github.com/kakty3/audeeo).

Tech-geek, idealist. Like well-thought things, and try to do exactly that. However trying to keep idealism in check: actually solving problems is more important, than new cool tricks.
Non-smoker, social drinker. Not married.
B2 English level.
